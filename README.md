<h1>CIFAR-10 Classification Project</h1>

Link to download the CIFAR-10 database: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

CIFAR-10 is a benchmark popular datasets used in machine learning literature for bechmarking different methods. For brief introduction, please check https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

In this project, I've implemented several method of machine learning and pattern recognition to classify different images from the CIFAR-10 database like 1-NN, Bayesian, and neural network classifier. The downloaded CIFAR-10 database should be in the root directory.
